    <title>Privacy Policy - FB Mastery Guide</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Facebook Inspired (fb-blue, fb-dark, fb-light) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A clean, single-column, responsive layout was chosen to present the legal text of the Privacy Policy in a clear, readable, and professional manner. The goal is legal clarity and user accessibility. A header provides navigation back to the main site for a cohesive user experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The legal text was translated to semantic HTML (headings, paragraphs, lists) to maintain structure and readability. No charts or visualizations are needed. The chosen presentation method is a static, styled text document, as is standard for legal agreements. No JS libraries needed. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
